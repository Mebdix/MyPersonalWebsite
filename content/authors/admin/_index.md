Malek Ebadi is an industrial engineer experienced in decision making under uncertainty with applications in public health and medical decision making, maintenance and crowd-sourcing.

His Ph.D. dissertation considers optimal screening decision making for cervical cancer patients. The problem is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) which is known to be doubly cursed: curse of dimensionality and curse of horizon. Following this thread, he is investigating algorithmic improvements in approximate solutions of the POMDP problems.
